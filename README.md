Smart Irrigation with Agricultural Plant Growth Surveillance and Stock Marketing System

Technology has developed almost in all the fields. This is widely observed in the 
current scenario. Agriculture is the main source for Nation’s economy and also for 
human beings’ survival. Farmers are the backbone who struggles and do hard work for 
the nation’s development. The theme of this project is to provide farmers all the details 
of the plant growth process and controlling of irrigation, spraying of fertilizers and 
pesticides in the detected areas of deficiency of plants using AI prediction can be done 
with low cost investment with our own Indian made microprocessor. This project also 
introduces stock marketing and rental technique for the ease of farmers. Data of plant 
growth process and maintenance can be retrieved from the cloud service. Information 
such as Water level, temperature, and humidity, defects in plants, growth rate, gross 
profit and loss, need of pesticides and fertilizers will be notified to the farmer with 
custom build application using IOT platform.
